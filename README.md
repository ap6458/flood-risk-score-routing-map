# 🌊 Flood Risk Score Routing Map

A smart web-based flood-aware route planning system that calculates **real-world road routes** and integrates **flood risk scoring** to help users choose the safest path during heavy rainfall or waterlogging conditions.

Built using **Next.js, Leaflet (OpenStreetMap), Mapbox APIs, and MongoDB**.

## 🧠 How Risk Scoring Works

Each route is evaluated based on:

1. Distance from known waterlogging points  
2. Severity weighting (Low / Moderate / High)  
3. Distance-based risk multiplier  
4. Proximity to live user-reported flood points

Final Risk Score:
Individual routes are assigned route risk scores.The route with lowest score is considered the safest

Routes are sorted from **lowest risk → highest risk**.
